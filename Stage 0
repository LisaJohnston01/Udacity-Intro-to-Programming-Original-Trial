<h1>Important Concepts </h1>
<br>
<h2>What is Coding?</h2>
<p><b><em>"Coding"</em></b> a computer means telling a 
computer what you want it to do by writing 
text in a way it can understand.  It is just a speical 
language or <b><em>"syntax"</em></b> 
the computer translates to instruction or information 
it can understand.</p>
<h2>Thinking Like a Programmer</h2>
<p>There are five (5) different ways a programmer thinks:<br>
  <br>1.<b><em>Procedural Thinking</em></b> - Creating perfectly clear unambiguous
  instructions for a computer to follow.<br>
  2.<b><em>Abstract Thinking</em></b> -Finding similarity or generality amongst 
  seemingly different things.<br>
  3.<b><em>Systems Thinking</em></b> - B.reaking a big problem down into smaller 
  pieces.  This is also known as big picture thinking and decision making.<br>
  4.<b><em>Technological Empathy</em></b> - This comes in many different forms.  One
  example is <b><em>computer empathy</em></b>.  Computer empathy is the ability to
  understand what a computer is, how it works, and what its good and bad
  at doing.<br>
  5.<b><em>Degugging</em></b> - A systematic process of relentlessly identifying
  the cause of a computer program that doesn't work.  Mistakes are unavoidable so
  each programmer has a system to fix the problem or <b><em>"debug"</em></b> the
    program.  This generally involves collecting the evidence, generating theories, 
    testing the theories and then fixing the problem.

  <h3>The Basic of the Web and HTML</h3>
  <br>
  <p>The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML (<em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>) 
  documents.  It was invented in the early 1990's and have over 30 Billion pages.</p>
  <p> There are five (5) basic components of the Web.<br>
    1. The Web<br>
    2. HTML<br>
    3. URLs<br>
    4. HTTP<br>
    5. Web Applications<br>
    <br>
    HTML is the main type of document of the web.  It is the basis for everything 
    on the web.  Although HTML is the basis, you can find other types of files such
    as Plain Text, Images, Videos and Music.  </p>
    <br><b>What are the major pieces of the Web?</b> <br><br> The major pieces include: <br><br>
    
    1.  You and your computer plus a browser.  <em>(a browser is a program that runs 
      on your computer to display files found on the web)</em><br>
      2. The Internet <em>(the world's largest computer network)</em><br>
      3. HTTP <em>(the main protocol of the web)</em><br>
      4. Servers <em>computers that host the files)</em><br>
      <br>
      <b>What is HTML made up of?</b><br>
      HTML is made up of:<br>
      Text content <em>(what you see)</em><br>
      Markup <em>(what it looks like)</em><br>
      References to other documents <em>(such as images and videos)</em><br>
      Links to other pages<br><br>

      <h4> Programmers Cannot remember everything!</h4><br>
      <p> There is a lot to remember when coding and there is no way a programmer can 
        remember all the details needed in building all codes...and since computers are
        stupid without our detailed instructions to tell them what to do, there must be
        resources to find the information when you need it.  There are many resources
        available such as <em>www.google.com</em>.  Programmers should be able to find any
        information they need to code.</p><br>
        <h5>Basic HTML Vocabulary</h5><br>
        <p>Here is some of the jargon you should be familiar with when using HTML.<br><br>
          <b>Tag</b> - An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets.  
          Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag.   Some tags <em>(called void 
            tags)</em> do not require a closing tag.  There are two types of tags.  InLine
            and block tags.  Some examples of InLine elements are:  a, span, br, imp, 
            and strong. </p>
          <p><b>Element</b> - An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening 
          and0 closing tags.</p>
          <p><b>Attribute</b> - This is a property of an HTML element.  It tells the 
            attribte of a grouping such as href will give the web address as an 
            attribute in a series of coded information.      </p><br><br>
            There is much more valuable information in this lesson but not enough time 
            to capure all the details.  I will <b>LOVE</b> learning to code!!
